# Parallel-Programming-Course

This repo houses my codes for parallel programming computer assignments.

There were four assignments in each CA: 

* Finding the minimum of a large floating point array and its index
* Computing the standard deviation and variance of a large floating point array

* Finding movement in two pictures by calculating difference of each pixel's value
* Adding a smaller picture to a larger picture with ùõº transparency coefficient

Each assignment was done using three methods:

* Using intel's SIMD intrinsics
* Using OpenMP

* Using Posix Thread parallelization
